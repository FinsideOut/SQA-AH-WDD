            <h2>What are Media Queries?</h2>
            <p>Media queries in CSS are a powerful tool that allow you to apply different styles to a webpage based on
                the
                characteristics of the device or viewport displaying the content. They enable responsive design by
                targeting
                specific conditions like screen width, height, resolution, or orientation. For example, you can use
                media
                queries to adjust the layout of a website for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices, ensuring an optimal
                viewing
                experience across a range of screen sizes and devices.</p>

            <h2>How Do They Work?</h2>
            <p>Media queries work by applying conditional logic to CSS rules, allowing styles to be tailored based on
                the
                device's characteristics. A media query consists of a "media type" (like screen or print) and an
                optional
                "media
                feature" (like width, height, or orientation). When the conditions specified in the media query are met,
                the
                associated styles are applied. For example, a media query might check if the viewport width is smaller
                than
                600px and, if true, adjust the layout to stack elements vertically for better readability on mobile
                devices.
                This flexibility helps create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and user contexts.

            <h2>Learn more about display:flex</h2>
            <p>
                The header uses display:flex to dynamically position content. It does a similar thing to float:left and
                float:right, but is far easier and less archaic. This is the kind of thing you can get extra marks for
                in your project...

            <h3>What do you mean, extra marks!?!?!</h3>
            <p>In your project, 4 marks are available for implementing code that is not in the AH course. This will
                require your own research to decide what is most appropriate. Flexbox or CSS Grids are a good jumping
                off point</p>
